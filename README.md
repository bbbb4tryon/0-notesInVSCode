## Scrum And Agile Topics

1. [Product Backlog: Grooming the Product Backlog](#grooming_product_backlog)

<a name="types--grooming_product_backlog"></a><a name="SA1. product backlog: grooming the product backlog"></a>

[SA1.](#types--grooming_product_backlog) ***Refining the Product Backlog***: Making this into workable steps by answering "<em>Are the Issues and Stories still relevant? Has a feature replaced them? Did a function or feature make it obsolete?</em>"

```
Do this via "Definition of Ready: Checklist" for each Story in the Backlog: 
[ ] Actionable, no dependencies are needed
[ ] Refined, understand what needs to be done
[ ] Valuable, the fix/feature brings value to the User
[ ] Small, the Step/Story can fit into a single sprint (if necessary, break into smaller pieces)
[ ] Testable, with [context knowledge](#link), perform the unit and acceptance testing
TODO: add the #link
```

SA2. [User Story: Drafting Tips](@user_story_drafting_tips)

<a name="types--user_story_drafting-tips"></a><a name="SA2. user story: drafting tips"></a>

[SA2.](#types--user_story_drafting_tips) ***How to Create User Stories***: the point of a user story is NOT to tell the development team how to do stuff. That's not agile, that's waterfall.

Convey the issue so the developer can understand how the user would interact, then the <strong>developer</strong> comes up with the solution. Like pseudo-coding it.

<em>"As a [type of user/description], I want to [perform an action/(this defines the acceptance criteria too)] so that [a benefit of the said feature/fix]!" </em>

Good example:
```
As a site member, I want to view the profiles of other members so that I can find others I might want to connect with.
```
Bad example:
```
As a site member, I want to view profiles by clicking a button in the top left corner which is 20px*20px and centered in the middle, written in X language. This should then add that user to my account linked by my hash Id.
```
```
FULL TICKET EXAMPLE: 
User story: As a site member, I want to view the profiles of other members so that I can find others I might want to connect with.

Acceptance criteria:

* The user can view other users profiles

* The user can add other users

* The user can view who they've added

* Project plan (link) 

* Design (link)

SA3. User Story To Direct Your App from Agile to Kaban Cards: 

<a name="types--user_story_examples"></a><a name="SA3. user story: examples"></a>

[SA3](#types--user_story_examples) ***User Story Examples***: 

<strong>1. User story for transferring money</strong>
Sending money through mobile apps can speed up the transcation process. Unlike checks, digital money transfers can be instantly processed, making it easier to manage a user's finances, and not cause delays, especially with large transactions.

#### Transfer Money User Story
User Story  As a <strong>regular fintech app user</strong>, I want to <strong>transfer money</strong> from my bank account to another account using the Mobile App, so I can <strong>easily manage my finances and pay my bills on time.</strong>

Acceptance Criteria: 
- User can login to the mobile app
- User can enter the desired amount to transfer
- Desired amount is validated: within the user's current balance
- Receiver's account information is authenticated prior to transfer
- Both accounts are updated concurrently after validation
- Email and in-app confirmation of transactions are sent to the user and the receive

<strong>2. User story for withdrawing money</strong>
Another innovation fintech offers is the convinences of withdrawing money in the Web. Money can be withdrawn online if users have ATM cash cards that accept cash via quick response (QR) codes.


#### User Story for Withdrawing Cash
User Story  As a <strong>regular fintech app user</strong>, I want to <strong>withdraw money</strong> from my bank account using the Mobile App, so I can <strong>easily draw out cash even when I don't have my card.</strong>

Acceptance Criteria: 
- User can login to the mobile app
- User can enter the desired amount to withdraw
- Desired amount is validated: within the user's current balance
- Account(s) updated concurrently after validation
- Email and in-app confirmation of transactions are sent to the user

## Essentials

<a name="types--configure"></a><a name="1.a. configure a target for your app"></a>

[1.a.](#types--configure) ***Configuring***: Xcode determines how to build apps and other products from your project's target information.



<a name="types--target"></a><a name="1.b. target (parts and pieces)"></a>

[1.b.](#types--target) ***Target***: the `target` contains the tasks required to create executable plus the `settings` to build it, by default.
   <ul type='disc'>the templates have default targets which Xcode configures using the information you provide (you can change and [configure a new target](#link) for your Project, as ncessary) </ul>



<a name="types--buildScheme"></a><a name="1.c. build scheme"></a>

[1.c.](#types--buildScheme) ***Build Scheme***: A collection of settings that specify which `targets` to build, which `configuration` to build, and the executable environment for running the product
   - Xcode creates schemes automaticallly, and display it in the toolbar. Click it if youd need to choose a new one, and a pop-up menu list will show
   - You may create your own, to pass additional launch arguments to your app, for example



<a name="types--initialStepsToBuild"></a><a name="1.d. building an app (or anything else)"></a>

[1.d.](#types--initialStepsToBuild) ***Run and Build An App***: Once you select a `scheme`, also select the `target`. 
- Select the real or simulated devices, the 'available destination' in documentation (usually a pop-out from the scheme listed in the toolbar).

- Before you ship, use a real device --> Simulators work and do a lot, but an actual device is for real condition-testing



<a name="types--buildApp"></a><a name="1.e. build"></a>

[1.e.](#types--buildApp) ***Build***: Design and code out your app. Then, choose `Product > Run` or Cmd + R.
- Xcode attaches your schemes, builds them in the proper sequence



<a name="types--buildWithoutRunning"></a><a name="1.g. build without running simulator or device"></a>

[1.f.](#types--buildWithoutRunning) ***Build Without Running***: To build a scheme <em>without</em> running the app, `Cmd + B` or `Product > Build`


*Debugging*
<a name="types--debugApp"></a><a name="1.f. debug"></a>

[1.g.](#types--debug) ***Debug***: Enable the process like so `Debug > Debug Executable`, and the debug terminal will appear at the bottom of the console. 


<a name="types--issueNavigator"></a><a name="1.h. issue navigator"></a>

[1.h.](#types---issueNavigator) ***Issue Navigator***: If Xcode encounters an error during build, it report it in the issue navigator and stop. The issue navigator is an icon/option at the top of the editor column. You can enable or disable stopping from the `General` tab in `Preferences > Continue building after errors`. Or stop an in-progress build: `Product > Stop`. 


*Misc*
<a name="types--workspaces"></a><a name="1.i. workspaces"></a>

[1.i.](#types--workspaces) ***Workspaces***: A workspace is a container for related projects
- Use a workspace to organize multiple projects that have explicit or implicit dependencies with each ohter
- `File > New > Workspace` Then, in the Project Navigator, click on empty space to "Add files to `workspace`name
- In that Finder view, select the .xcodeproj you need, click `Add` the project to the workspace
   * Xcode will automatically build the dependences.



<a name="types--crossProjectReferences"></a><a name="1.j. cross-project references"></a>

[1.j.](#types--crossProjectReferences) ***Cross-Project References***: Since a workspace project can't refer to targets, files or products <em>in another project</em>, you must build cross-project references.
- Open Project Navigator in your Xcode project
- Click the Add button (+) at the <em>bottom</em> of the Project Navigator
- Choose "`Add Files to `project"
- Select another .xcodeproj to link to
- Click `Add`
 * After you add the cross-project reference, you can refer to outside elements in your project -- from dependencies, to copying files and Link Binaries with Library build phases

API Collections

---

<a name="types--appInfoPList"></a><a name="2.a. app information property list api collection"></a>

[2.a.](#types--appInfoPList) ***App Information Property List aka Info.plist***: usually require "key" test and NAME: strings that explain the purpose and function of the "key"

+ one `Info.plist` per <em>target</em> in the Project folder
+ Xcode sets most property list keys automatically
+ find editable information at the target's `General` pane (white one with 'Signing' 'Resource Tags' 'Info' headings)
+ `Localization` in the Inspector (right side column), select the resources of a region (like language)
+ Knowledge:
   - `UIMainStoryboardFile` key specifies main storyboard in an iOS app that uses Storyboard config

+ Xcode sets keys to update/be replaced at build time
   - ex: `CFBundleIdentifier` updates to value of `$(PRODUCT_BUILD_IDENTIFIER)`

+ Platform- and Device-Specific [<em>Keys</em>](#https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/managing_your_app_s_information_property_list):
   - syntax for the key: [`key name`]-[`platform`]~[`device`]
   - restricts the value for the key to the platform or device
   - ex: `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad` - sets different orientation values for iPad devices
   - platform and device are optional

+ Why the source and build lists are <em>different</em> 
   - at build time/whenever you build the app, Xcode ensures that the final file has the correct name and resides in the correct location for the given bundle type 
   - Xcode uses build settings to perform variable substitution
   - inserts configurations you specify in other ways: you indicate the deployment target for an iOS app in Xcodeâ€™s project editor, translated to `MinimumOSVersion` key that it adds during the copy
   - <strong>As a result of these changes, the information property list file that ships with your app isnâ€™t identical to the source file in your project.</strong>



<a  name="types--bundleConfiguration"></a><a name="2.b. bundle configuration api collection"></a>

[2.b.](#types--bundleConfiguration) ***Bundle Configuration***: Defines basic characteristics of a bundle like name, type and version [(among others)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/bundle_configuration)

+ Bundles are a Core setting - meta data - the `Information Property List` associated with a bundle tells you how to interpret the bundle contents, generally strings or Booleans
+ Ex: <strong>Categorization: </strong> property list key `CFBundlePackageType`
   - defined: 'the type of bundle'
   - NAME: Bundle OS Type Code
      + these keys are 4-letter codes defining the bundle type; APPL for apps, FMWK for frameworks, BNDL (also the default value) for bundles



<a name="types--userInterface"></a><a name="2.c. user interface api collection"></a>

[2.c.](#types--userInterface) [***User Interface***](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/user_interface): Defines the app scenes, iconts, fonts, 'storyboards', etc, generally strings or Booleans

+ UI is a Core setting - meta data - you define the UI as you code, however, the system needs starter values about the app users (largely this is a reminder to check it, not necessarily change it since Xcode manages a lot of it)
   - Add keys to the `Info.plist` to control some UI:
      + from the property list key `UILaunchScreen`: UI to show when the app launches
      + to... `UIAppFonts`: app-specific font files, located in the bundle, and that the system loads at runtime

+ ex: if your app requires device orientation changes



<a name="types--appExecution"></a><a name="2.e. app execution api collection"></a>

[2.e](#types--appExecution) [***App Execution***](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/app_execution): Control app launch, execution and termination, generally strings or Booleans

+ Your app interacts with the system during normal execution by calling system APIs
+ You must communication under what conditions your app can launce, the environment it should launch too, and what should happen if it terminates
+ All done via keys in the project's `Info.plist`, for example:
   - property list key `UIRequiredDeviceCompatibilities`: device-related featuers that your app requires to run
   - property list key `UIBackgroundModes`: services provided by app that require it to run in the background
   - property list ley `NSSupportsSuddenTermination`: a boolean value whether an application can be killed immediately after launch



<a name="types--protectedResources"></a><a name="2.d. protected resources api collection"></a>

[2.d.](#types--protectedResources)[***Protected Resources***](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/protected_resources): how one accesses system and user data, generally strings or Booleans

+ an api that controls whether and how the app can access certain "prtected resources", like the user location, ex:
+ to signal that your app needs the access, add `UsageDescription` key - you set the value via string, it tells the user why your app needs access
+ from `Motion` - property list key `NSMotionUsageDescription`: a <em>string</em> that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the devices motion data
